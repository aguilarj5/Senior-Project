# Senior-Project
Game Development

Attached is a zip file with my full project for my senior reasearch class, it contains the scripts, all the objects, and sprites I created/used to create my game, Digging for(Treasure). 

I have also attached text files with common code I used to develop most of the questions as well as player movement.
